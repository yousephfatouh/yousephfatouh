## 🧠 About Me

I am a SOC Analyst focused on defensive security operations, threat detection, and incident response.  
I work on building and operating SOC lab environments to simulate real-world enterprise security scenarios.

My interests include:

- Threat Intelligence (IOC Analysis, MITRE ATT&CK)
- Security Monitoring & Alert Triage
- Incident Handling & Root Cause Analysis
- Network Security & Firewall Technologies
- SIEM & Log Analysis

Currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Network Technology and continuously building hands-on security labs.
